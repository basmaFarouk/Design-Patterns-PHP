//The Command Design Pattern is ideal for scenarios where you need to encapsulate actions as objects, 
//enabling flexible execution, undo/redo functionality, queuing, or logging of operations. 
//It decouples the object that triggers an action (invoker) from the object that performs it (receiver), 
//making it versatile for various applications.

//Use Cases for the Command Design Pattern

//1-Undo/Redo in Text Editors
//Scenario: A text editor (e.g., Notepad++, Microsoft Word) allows users to perform actions like typing, deleting, 
//or formatting text and supports undoing or redoing those actions.
//Why Command?: Each action (e.g., “type a word,” “delete a character”) is encapsulated as a command object with execute and undo methods.
//The editor stores commands in a history stack for undo/redo.
//Example:
//Commands: TypeCommand, DeleteCommand, FormatCommand.
//Usage: Typing “Hello” creates a TypeCommand with the text and position. Undoing it removes “Hello” from the document.
//Benefit: Easily supports undo/redo and allows new actions to be added without modifying the editor’s core logic.


//2-Remote Control Systems
//Scenario: A smart home remote control operates devices like lights, fans, or TVs with commands like “turn on,” “turn off,” or “adjust volume.”
//Why Command?: Each device operation is encapsulated as a command,
// allowing the remote (invoker) to trigger actions without knowing the device’s (receiver’s) implementation. 
//Commands can also support undo (e.g., turn off after turning on).
//Example:
//Commands: LightOnCommand, LightOffCommand, FanSpeedCommand.
//Usage: Pressing the “on” button executes LightOnCommand; pressing “undo” executes its undo method to turn the light off.
//Benefit: New devices or commands can be added without changing the remote’s logic.


//3-Task Queuing in Job Schedulers
//Scenario: A job scheduler in a system queues tasks like sending emails, processing files, or running backups to be executed later.
//Why Command?: Each task is encapsulated as a command, allowing the scheduler to queue, prioritize, or delay execution. 
//Commands can store parameters (e.g., email recipient) for later use.
//Example:
//Commands: SendEmailCommand, ProcessFileCommand, BackupCommand.
//Usage: A SendEmailCommand is created with recipient and message details, queued, and executed when resources are available.
//Benefit: Supports delayed execution and queuing, with easy addition of new task types.


//4-Transaction Systems in Databases
//Scenario: A database application executes transactions (e.g., insert, update, delete) and supports rolling back changes if a transaction fails.
//Why Command?: Each database operation is encapsulated as a command with execute and undo methods, 
//enabling transaction logging and rollback capabilities.
//Example:
//Commands: InsertRecordCommand, UpdateRecordCommand, DeleteRecordCommand.
//Usage: An InsertRecordCommand adds a record; if the transaction fails, its undo method removes the record.
//Benefit: Simplifies transaction management and ensures consistency through rollback.


//5-Menu-Driven Applications
//Scenario: A GUI application (e.g., a drawing app) has menu items or buttons for actions like “save,” “print,” or “draw shape.”
//Why Command?: Each menu action is encapsulated as a command, decoupling the UI (invoker) from the action’s implementation (receiver). 
//Commands can also support undo or macro recording.
//Example:
//Commands: SaveCommand, PrintCommand, DrawCircleCommand.
//Usage: Clicking “Save” executes a SaveCommand; clicking “Undo” reverts the save operation.
//Benefit: New menu actions can be added without modifying the UI framework.


//6-Game Action Systems
//Scenario: A video game allows players to perform actions like moving a character, attacking, or casting a spell, 
//with support for undoing actions or replaying sequences.
//Why Command?: Each action is encapsulated as a command, enabling execution, undo, or logging for replay (e.g., for tutorials or replays).
//Example:
//Commands: MoveCharacterCommand, AttackCommand, CastSpellCommand.
//Usage: Moving a character creates a MoveCharacterCommand with coordinates; undoing it moves the character back.
//Benefit: Supports undo, replay, and easy addition of new actions.


//7-Macro Recording and Playback
//Scenario: An application (e.g., a spreadsheet or automation tool) records a sequence of user actions as a macro to replay later.
//Why Command?: Each user action is stored as a command object, allowing the sequence to be saved, replayed, or modified. 
//Commands can also support parameterization (e.g., specific cell edits).
//Example:
//Commands: EditCellCommand, FormatCellCommand, InsertRowCommand.
//Usage: Recording a macro stores a list of commands (e.g., edit cell A1, format as bold); playback executes them in order.
//Benefit: Simplifies macro management and supports extensibility for new actions.


//8-ogging and Auditing Systems
//Scenario: A financial application logs user actions (e.g., transferring funds, updating accounts) for auditing or compliance purposes.
//Why Command?: Each action is encapsulated as a command, allowing the system to log the command’s details (e.g., parameters, timestamp) 
//before or after execution.
//Example:
//Commands: TransferFundsCommand, UpdateAccountCommand.
//Usage: A TransferFundsCommand logs the amount and accounts involved before executing the transfer.
//Benefit: Centralizes logging logic and allows auditing without modifying the core application.


//Why Use the Command Pattern?
//The Command pattern is a great fit when:
//You need to encapsulate actions as objects for undo/redo, queuing, or logging.
//You want to decouple the invoker (e.g., UI button, scheduler) from the receiver (e.g., device, database).
//You require parameterized or delayed execution, such as scheduling tasks or configuring actions with specific data.
//You anticipate extending actions, as new commands can be added without modifying existing code.

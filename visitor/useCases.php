// The Visitor Design Pattern allows you to add new operations to existing object structures 
// without modifying the structures themselves. It separates algorithms from the objects on which they operate, 
// enabling you to define new behaviors externally. 
// It is ideal for situations where you have a stable object hierarchy and need to perform varied operations 
// on its elements without altering their classes.

// The Visitor Design Pattern allows adding new operations to a set of objects without modifying their classes.
// It separates the algorithm for operating on elements from the elements themselves, enabling you to add new operations
// by creating new visitor classes while keeping the element hierarchy stable.

// Use Cases for the Visitor Design Pattern

// 1-AST Processing in Compilers
// Scenario: A compiler processes an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representing code, performing operations like type-checking, code generation, or pretty-printing.
// Why Visitor?: The AST node hierarchy is stable, but new operations (e.g., optimization passes) are frequently added without altering the nodes. 
// The Visitor pattern allows encapsulating operations in visitors, keeping nodes simple and focused on structure.
// Example:
// - Elements: Node hierarchy like `ExpressionNode`, `StatementNode`, `FunctionNode`.
// - Visitors: `TypeCheckerVisitor`, `CodeGeneratorVisitor`, `PrettyPrinterVisitor`.
// - Usage: The compiler accepts a `TypeCheckerVisitor` on the AST root, traversing and applying type-checking logic to each node type.
// - Benefit: New compiler passes (e.g., optimization) can be added as new visitors without modifying the AST node classes.

// 2-GUI Component Rendering
// Scenario: A GUI framework renders different components (e.g., buttons, panels, text fields) to various outputs like screen, printer, or PDF.
// Why Visitor?: The component hierarchy is fixed, but rendering operations vary by output medium and are added over time. 
// The Visitor pattern separates rendering logic from components, allowing new renderers without changing components.
// Example:
// - Elements: Component hierarchy like `Button`, `Panel`, `TextField`.
// - Visitors: `ScreenRendererVisitor`, `PdfRendererVisitor`, `PrinterVisitor`.
// - Usage: The GUI tree accepts a `PdfRendererVisitor`, which traverses components and generates PDF-specific output for each type.
// - Benefit: New rendering targets (e.g., SVG export) can be added as new visitors without altering the component classes.

// 3-Employee Payroll Calculation
// Scenario: An HR system calculates payroll elements (e.g., salary, bonuses, taxes) for different employee types (e.g., full-time, contractor, manager).
// Why Visitor?: The employee hierarchy is stable, but payroll rules (e.g., tax calculations) change frequently or need new computations. 
// The Visitor pattern allows defining payroll operations in visitors, avoiding modifications to employee classes.
// Example:
// - Elements: Employee hierarchy like `FullTimeEmployee`, `Contractor`, `Manager`.
// - Visitors: `SalaryCalculatorVisitor`, `TaxDeductionVisitor`, `BonusCalculatorVisitor`.
// - Usage: The employee list accepts a `TaxDeductionVisitor`, which computes taxes based on each employee type without changing their code.
// - Benefit: New payroll operations (e.g., benefits deduction) can be added as new visitors without updating employee classes.

// 4-File System Traversal and Operations
// Scenario: A file explorer tool performs operations on a file system structure (e.g., files, directories) like calculating total size, searching, or compressing.
// Why Visitor?: The file/directory hierarchy is fixed, but operations like duplication checks or virus scanning are added dynamically. 
// The Visitor pattern encapsulates operations in visitors, keeping file classes focused on structure.
// Example:
// - Elements: Node hierarchy like `File`, `Directory`.
// - Visitors: `SizeCalculatorVisitor`, `SearchVisitor`, `CompressorVisitor`.
// - Usage: The root directory accepts a `SizeCalculatorVisitor`, which traverses the tree and sums sizes for files and recurses into directories.
// - Benefit: New file system operations (e.g., permission checker) can be added as new visitors without modifying file/directory classes.

// 5-DOM Manipulation in Web Parsers
// Scenario: An XML/HTML parser processes a Document Object Model (DOM) tree for operations like validation, transformation, or serialization.
// Why Visitor?: The DOM element hierarchy (e.g., tags, attributes) is standard and stable, but new processing tasks (e.g., XSLT transformations) are common. 
// The Visitor pattern allows separating operations from the DOM structure for easier extension.
// Example:
// - Elements: Node hierarchy like `ElementNode`, `TextNode`, `AttributeNode`.
// - Visitors: `ValidatorVisitor`, `TransformerVisitor`, `SerializerVisitor`.
// - Usage: The DOM root accepts a `ValidatorVisitor`, which checks validity for each node type (e.g., required attributes on elements).
// - Benefit: New DOM operations (e.g., query extractor) can be added as new visitors without changing the core DOM classes.

// 6-Configuration File Processing
// Scenario: A system processes configuration files structured as a tree (e.g., sections, key-value pairs) for operations like validation, merging, or exporting.
// Why Visitor?: The config node hierarchy is fixed, but processing logic (e.g., environment-specific overrides) evolves. 
// The Visitor pattern keeps configs simple while allowing new operations via visitors.
// Example:
// - Elements: Node hierarchy like `SectionNode`, `KeyValueNode`.
// - Visitors: `ValidatorVisitor`, `MergerVisitor`, `ExporterVisitor`.
// - Usage: The config tree accepts a `MergerVisitor` to merge values from different environments, handling sections and keys appropriately.
// - Benefit: New config operations (e.g., encryption checker) can be added as new visitors without altering config node classes.

// 7-Game Object Collision Detection
// Scenario: A game engine manages objects (e.g., players, obstacles, projectiles) and performs collision detection or interaction logic.
// Why Visitor?: The object hierarchy is stable, but interaction rules (e.g., damage calculation, sound effects) change with game updates. 
// The Visitor pattern separates collision operations from objects, enabling easy addition of new rules.
// Example:
// - Elements: Object hierarchy like `Player`, `Obstacle`, `Projectile`.
// - Visitors: `CollisionDetectorVisitor`, `DamageCalculatorVisitor`, `EffectApplierVisitor`.
// - Usage: A `Projectile` object accepts a `DamageCalculatorVisitor` during collision, applying damage based on the target's type.
// - Benefit: New interaction types (e.g., power-up effects) can be added as new visitors without modifying game object classes.

// Why Use the Visitor Pattern?
// The Visitor pattern is a great fit when:
// - You have a stable class hierarchy of elements but need to add new operations frequently without modifying the elements.
// - Operations vary significantly by element type, and you want to centralize type-specific logic in visitors.
// - You want to separate algorithms from the object structure to improve maintainability and extensibility.
// - Traversing and operating on a complex object structure (e.g., tree or graph) is required.

// General Benefits Across Use Cases
// 1-Extensibility: Add new operations by creating visitor classes without changing element hierarchies.
// 2-Single Responsibility: Elements focus on structure, while visitors handle specific operations.
// 3-Type Safety: Visitors can implement type-specific logic without conditional checks in elements.
// 4-Maintainability: Changes to operations are isolated to visitors, making the system easier to evolve.

//The Mediator Design Pattern is ideal for scenarios where multiple objects need to interact in complex ways, 
//and you want to reduce direct dependencies between them by centralizing communication through a mediator. 
//This promotes loose coupling and simplifies maintenance.

//Use Cases for the Mediator Design Pattern

//1-Chat Room Applications
//Scenario: A chat application allows multiple users to send and receive messages, with the chat server managing message distribution.
//Why Mediator?: The chat server acts as a mediator, coordinating message exchange between users. 
//Users don’t communicate directly; instead, they send messages to the mediator, which routes them to the appropriate recipients.
//Example:
//Mediator: ChatRoom.
//Colleagues: User objects.
//Usage: A user sends a message to the chat room, which broadcasts it to all other users or sends it to a specific user.
//Benefit: Adding new users or features (e.g., private messaging) only requires updating the mediator, not the user class.


//2-Air Traffic Control System
//Scenario: An air traffic control system manages communication between airplanes to prevent collisions and coordinate landings.
//Why Mediator?: The control tower acts as a mediator, coordinating communication and instructions between airplanes. 
//Airplanes don’t communicate directly with each other, reducing complexity and ensuring safety.
//Example:
//Mediator: ControlTower.
//Colleagues: Airplane objects.
//Usage: An airplane requests permission to land, and the control tower notifies other airplanes to adjust their paths if needed.
//Benefit: Centralizes complex coordination logic, making it easier to manage interactions.


//3-GUI Component Interactions
//Scenario: A graphical user interface (GUI) has components like buttons, text fields, 
//and dropdowns that need to interact (e.g., enabling a button when a text field is filled).
//Why Mediator?: A mediator (e.g., a form controller) manages interactions between components, 
//ensuring they don’t need direct references to each other, reducing coupling.
//Example:
//Mediator: FormMediator.
//Colleagues: TextField, Button, Dropdown.
//Usage: When a text field is filled, the mediator enables the submit button; when a dropdown selection changes, 
//the mediator updates related fields.
//Benefit: Simplifies component interactions and makes it easy to add new components.


//4-Event Bus in Event-Driven Systems
//Scenario: A system uses an event bus to handle events (e.g., user actions, system notifications) and distribute them to relevant subscribers.
//Why Mediator?: The event bus acts as a mediator, routing events from publishers to subscribers without requiring them to know about each other.
//Example:
//Mediator: EventBus.
//Colleagues: EventPublisher, EventSubscriber.
//Usage: A user action (e.g., clicking “save”) triggers an event, and the event bus notifies subscribers like a logger or UI updater.
//Benefit: Decouples event producers and consumers, supporting dynamic subscriptions.


//5-IoT Device Coordination
//Scenario: A smart home system coordinates devices like lights, thermostats, 
//and sensors (e.g., turning on lights when a motion sensor is triggered).
//Why Mediator?: A central hub (mediator) manages communication between devices, 
//ensuring they don’t need direct connections, which simplifies integration.
//Example:
//Mediator: SmartHomeHub.
//Colleagues: Light, MotionSensor, Thermostat.
//Usage: A motion sensor detects movement and notifies the hub, which turns on the lights and adjusts the thermostat.
//Benefit: New devices can be added by integrating with the hub, not other devices.


//6-Online Multiplayer Games
//Scenario: A multiplayer game server manages interactions between players (e.g., attacks, trades, or chat) in a game session.
//Why Mediator?: The game server acts as a mediator, handling player actions and updating game state without 
//players directly interacting with each other.
//Example:
//Mediator: GameServer.
//Colleagues: Player objects.
//Usage: A player attacks another, and the server updates health, notifies players, and logs the action.
//Benefit: Centralizes game logic and reduces player-to-player dependencies.


//7-Workflow Orchestration
//Scenario: A business process management system coordinates tasks between departments (e.g., sales, inventory, shipping) for order processing.
//Why Mediator?: A workflow engine (mediator) manages task assignments and communication,
//ensuring departments don’t need to know about each other’s implementations.
//Example:
//Mediator: WorkflowEngine.
//Colleagues: SalesDepartment, InventoryDepartment, ShippingDepartment.
//Usage: An order is placed, and the workflow engine notifies inventory to check stock, then shipping to dispatch.
//Benefit: Simplifies complex workflows and supports adding new departments.


//8-Network Routing Systems
//Scenario: A network router manages communication between devices in a network, routing packets to the correct destination.
//Why Mediator?: The router acts as a mediator, handling packet routing and communication 
//protocols without devices needing to know each other’s details.
//Example:
//Mediator: Router.
//Colleagues: Device objects (e.g., computers, printers).
//Usage: A device sends a packet, and the router forwards it to the intended recipient.
//Benefit: Centralizes routing logic, making it easy to add new devices.


//Why Use the Mediator Pattern?
//The Mediator pattern is a great fit when:
//Multiple objects interact in complex ways, and direct communication would create tight coupling.
//You want to centralize communication logic to simplify maintenance and reduce dependencies.
//You need to coordinate behavior between objects dynamically, such as in event-driven or distributed systems.
//You anticipate adding new objects that need to interact with existing ones without modifying their code.

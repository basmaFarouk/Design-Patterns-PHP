// The Facade Design Pattern is a structural pattern that provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.
// It hides the complexities of the subsystem and exposes a single, unified interface to the client.
// The pattern is ideal when you want to reduce coupling between clients and a set of complex components,
// making the system easier to use and maintain.

// Use Cases for the Facade Design Pattern

// 1. Online Shopping Checkout System
// Scenario: An e-commerce platform needs to process orders involving inventory checks, payment processing,
// shipping calculations, and customer notifications.
// Why Facade?: Clients should not interact directly with multiple subsystems (inventory, payment, shipping, notifications)
// to complete an order. The Facade pattern simplifies the checkout process into a single method call.
// Example:
// Subsystem Components: InventoryService (checks stock), PaymentProcessor (handles payments),
// ShippingService (calculates costs and schedules delivery), NotificationService (sends emails/SMS).
// Facade: CheckoutFacade with a processOrder() method.
// Concrete Facade: CheckoutFacade coordinates stock checks, payment processing, shipping, and notifications.
// Usage: Client calls $checkoutFacade->processOrder($order) to handle all steps seamlessly.
// Benefit: Simplifies complex checkout process, reducing client code complexity and subsystem coupling.

// 2. Travel Booking System
// Scenario: A travel agency system books flights, hotels, car rentals, and processes payments for a trip.
// Why Facade?: Clients should not need to interact with separate flight, hotel, car rental, and payment systems.
// The Facade pattern provides a single interface to book an entire trip.
// Example:
// Subsystem Components: FlightManager (books flights), HotelReservation (reserves rooms),
// CarRental (rents vehicles), PaymentProcessor (handles payments via various methods).
// Facade: BookingTravelFacade with a bookTrip() method.
// Concrete Facade: BookingTravelFacade orchestrates flight booking, hotel reservation, car rental, and payment.
// Usage: Client calls $travelFacade->bookTrip($tripDetails) to arrange all travel components.
// Benefit: Unified trip booking process, hiding subsystem complexities and enabling easy modifications.

// 3. Media Conversion Pipeline
// Scenario: A media processing application converts video/audio files between formats, applies filters,
// and uploads results to cloud storage.
// Why Facade?: Clients should not manage individual steps like decoding, filtering, encoding, and uploading.
// The Facade pattern simplifies the conversion process into a single call.
// Example:
// Subsystem Components: Decoder (extracts raw media), FilterProcessor (applies effects),
// Encoder (converts to target format), CloudUploader (uploads to storage).
// Facade: MediaConverterFacade with a convertMedia() method.
// Concrete Facade: MediaConverterFacade coordinates decoding, filtering, encoding, and uploading.
// Usage: Client calls $mediaFacade->convertMedia($inputFile, $outputFormat) to process media.
// Benefit: Simplifies media conversion pipeline, making it easy to add new filters or storage options.

// 4. Home Automation System
// Scenario: A smart home system controls lights, thermostats, security cameras, and alarms with complex interactions.
// Why Facade?: Users should control the entire home setup (e.g., "movie mode") without managing individual devices.
// The Facade pattern provides a single interface for complex home automation tasks.
// Example:
// Subsystem Components: LightController (adjusts lights), Thermostat (sets temperature),
// CameraSystem (activates cameras), AlarmSystem (arms/disarms alarms).
// Facade: HomeAutomationFacade with methods like movieMode() or awayMode().
// Concrete Facade: HomeAutomationFacade dims lights, sets thermostat, and activates cameras for movie mode.
// Usage: Client calls $homeFacade->movieMode() to configure the home for movie watching.
// Benefit: Simplifies user interaction with multiple smart devices, allowing easy addition of new devices.

// 5. Banking Transaction System
// Scenario: A banking application processes transactions involving account validation, balance checks,
// fund transfers, and audit logging.
// Why Facade?: Clients should not handle the complexity of validating accounts, checking balances,
// and logging transactions separately. The Facade pattern simplifies the transaction process.
// Example:
// Subsystem Components: AccountValidator (verifies account), BalanceChecker (checks funds),
// TransferService (moves money), AuditLogger (logs transactions).
// Facade: TransactionFacade with a processTransaction() method.
// Concrete Facade: TransactionFacade validates accounts, checks balances, transfers funds, and logs.
// Usage: Client calls $transactionFacade->processTransaction($fromAccount, $toAccount, $amount).
// Benefit: Streamlines transaction processing, reducing errors and decoupling clients from subsystems.

// 6. Document Generation System
// Scenario: A reporting tool generates documents by fetching data, applying formatting,
// and exporting to various formats (PDF, Word, HTML).
// Why Facade?: Clients should not manage data retrieval, formatting, and export logic separately.
// The Facade pattern provides a single interface for document creation.
// Example:
// Subsystem Components: DataFetcher (retrieves data), Formatter (applies styles),
// Exporter (converts to PDF/Word/HTML).
// Facade: DocumentGeneratorFacade with a generateDocument() method.
// Concrete Facade: DocumentGeneratorFacade fetches data, formats it, and exports to the desired format.
// Usage: Client calls $documentFacade->generateDocument($dataSource, $format) to create a document.
// Benefit: Simplifies document generation, allowing easy addition of new formats or data sources.

// 7. Order Fulfillment System
// Scenario: A warehouse management system handles order fulfillment, including inventory allocation,
// picking, packing, and shipping.
// Why Facade?: Clients should not coordinate multiple warehouse processes manually.
// The Facade pattern simplifies order fulfillment into a single operation.
// Example:
// Subsystem Components: InventoryAllocator (reserves items), PickingService (retrieves items),
// PackingService (packs orders), ShippingService (arranges delivery).
// Facade: OrderFulfillmentFacade with a fulfillOrder() method.
// Concrete Facade: OrderFulfillmentFacade allocates inventory, picks items, packs, and ships.
// Usage: Client calls $fulfillmentFacade->fulfillOrder($orderId) to process an order.
// Benefit: Simplifies warehouse operations, reducing client interaction with complex subsystems.

// 8. Customer Support Ticketing System
// Scenario: A customer support system manages ticket creation, assignment, notifications, and escalations.
// Why Facade?: Support agents should not interact with ticket creation, assignment, and notification systems separately.
// The Facade pattern provides a single interface for managing support tickets.
// Example:
// Subsystem Components: TicketCreator (creates tickets), AgentAssigner (assigns agents),
// NotificationService (notifies customers), EscalationManager (handles escalations).
// Facade: SupportTicketFacade with a handleTicket() method.
// Concrete Facade: SupportTicketFacade creates tickets, assigns agents, notifies customers, and escalates if needed.
// Usage: Client calls $ticketFacade->handleTicket($customerId, $issue) to manage a support request.
// Benefit: Simplifies ticket management, allowing easy integration of new features like analytics.

// Why Use the Facade Pattern?
// The Facade pattern is perfect when:
// - A subsystem has multiple components with complex interactions that clients shouldn't need to understand.
// - You want to provide a simplified API for common tasks in a complex system.
// - You need to integrate with legacy systems or third-party libraries with intricate APIs.
// - You want to layer a system and define entry points for different levels of abstraction.
// - You need to reduce coupling between clients and subsystem components.

// General Benefits Across Use Cases
// 1. Simplified Interface: Reduces client code complexity by providing a single entry point.
// 2. Loose Coupling: Decouples clients from subsystem implementation details.
// 3. Maintainability: Subsystem changes (e.g., new payment gateways) donâ€™t affect client code.
// 4. Centralized Coordination: Encapsulates subsystem interactions and error handling.
// 5. Reusability: Facades can be reused across different clients or applications.
// 6. Improved Readability: Client code is cleaner, focusing on high-level operations.
